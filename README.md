# BibleBingo

The game of holy randomness. Have your bibles near.

1. Choose one or both testaments of the bible
2. Decide how many people are playing 
3. Click "Make Cards" button, which will change to "Print Cards"
4. Click "Print Cards" button then on the new tab/window print (CTRL+P)
5. Go to the game page after printing and start the game

This is meant to be an interactive game, so you have to print the generated bingo cards.
Each row/column contains: a book, a chapter number (bold), a starting verse number (bold italic), quantity verses number (most likely 7),  and a holy emoji.
When someone wins, they will get a random scripture from the bible based on their winning row/column on their bingo card.
